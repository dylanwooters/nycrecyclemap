nycrecyclemap
=============

Attempting to map all recycle bins in New York using JSON data from NYC OpenData, the Google Maps API,
and some JavaScript.

version notes
=============

v 1.0: Have the map working and JQuery in place to pull and parse the JSON. Need to get the markers
working.

v 1.1: Ditched getJSON for Google Fusion Table, since its layer provides better visibility than markers.
